# PyTorch and Apache Hadoop Learning Projects

This repository contains two projects designed to help you learn the basics of PyTorch and Apache Hadoop. The first project is a simple digit classification task using the MNIST dataset, and the second project is a basic data analysis task. Both projects aim to provide hands-on experience with these powerful technologies.

- [Project 1: Basic Data Analysis with PyTorch and Apache Hadoop](https://github.com/javiburn/Pytorch/tree/master/01_Basic%20Analysis)
    -  Using Hadoop to store and process a small dataset, and Pytorch to perform a basic analysis.
- [Project 2: Digit Classification with PyTorch and Apache Hadoop](https://github.com/javiburn/Pytorch/tree/master/02_Digital%20Classification)
    - Building and training a simple neural network model for the classification of digits using the MNIST dataset. Also, it uses Hadoop to handle storage and data processing.

- [Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews with PyTorch and Apache Spark](https://github.com/javiburn/Pytorch/tree/master/03_Sentiment%20Analysis%20on%20Movie%20Reviews)
    - Building a sentiment analysis model using PyTorch and process a dataset of movie reviews with Apache Spark to understand the basics of data preprocessing with Spark and building and training neural networks with PyTorch.
