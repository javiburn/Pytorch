# PyTorch and Apache Hadoop Learning Projects

This repository contains two projects designed to help you learn the basics of PyTorch and Apache Hadoop. The first project is a simple digit classification task using the MNIST dataset, and the second project is a basic data analysis task. Both projects aim to provide hands-on experience with these powerful technologies.
